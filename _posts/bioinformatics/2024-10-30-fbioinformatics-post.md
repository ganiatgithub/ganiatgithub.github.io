# Introduction
What's all these fuzz about precision therapy? How do we know exactly what genes to target?

Genome holds an incredible wealth of information, much like a vast ocean waiting to be explored. Unlocking these insights can seem overwhelming without the right approach. But if we can visualise genome, we are much closer to identify target genes.

# What do we have?

In this study, we aim to understand how two gene families are regulatedâ€”in other words, how their expression is controlled by other genetic elements. 

To answer this question, we first reconstructed genomes using high-throughput sequencing methods. Next, we annotated (i.e., assigned functions to) the genes. This was followed by visualising the genetic arrangement of key genes using a systematic approach.

Since we are particularly interested in the regulation of <span style="color: red;">gene family A</span> and <span style="color: red;">gene family B</span>, we identified both upstream and downstream genes adjacent to these gene families, in order to gain clues about potential regulators.

We found that the <span style="color: red;">regulator gene x</span> appears to regulate both gene families. Additionally, we identified a diverse range of other genes associated with both gene families. These genes are probably important as well, though their specific roles are yet to be determined.

## Implication

By understanding how genes are regulated, we can devise innovative ways to interfere with their expression, thereby engineering specific physiological traits. If a gene promotes health (e.g., by enhancing human well-being), we should probably do our best to keep it.

Now, the question for you, if a gene has harmful effects, what shall we do?
